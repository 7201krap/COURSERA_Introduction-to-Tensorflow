# Callback

'''
Earlier when you trained for extra epochs you had an issue where your loss might change. It might have taken a bit of time for you to wait for the training to do that, and you might have thought 'wouldn't it be nice if I could stop the training when I reach a desired value?' -- i.e. 95% accuracy might be enough for you, and if you reach that after 3 epochs, why sit around waiting for it to finish a lot more epochs....So how would you fix that? Like any other program...you have callbacks! Let's see them in action...

import tensorflow as tf

class myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):
    if(logs.get('acc')>0.9):
      print("\nReached 90% accuracy so cancelling training!")
      self.model.stop_training = True

mnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist

(x_train, y_train),(x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

callbacks = myCallback()

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation=tf.nn.relu),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax)
])
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(),
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[callbacks])
