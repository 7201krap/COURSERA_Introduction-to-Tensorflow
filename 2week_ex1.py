# Question. Increase to 1024 Neurons -- What's the impact?

'''
The correct answer is: by adding more Neurons we have to do more calculations, slowing down the process, but in this case they have a good impact -- we do get more accurate. That doesn't mean it's always a case of 'more is better', you can hit the law of diminishing returns very quickly!
